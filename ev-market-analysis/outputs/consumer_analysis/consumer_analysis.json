While interest in electric vehicles is shooting up like a rocket, the survey results reveal that range anxiety, high prices, and the availability of charging stations are still the top barriers preventing many consumers from fully committing to EV ownership. Range anxiety and the availability of charging stations remain the top barriers to EV adoption, but a significant portion of consumers are ready to embrace EVs once these concerns are alleviated.",

The EV Index offers one of the industry’s most comprehensive assessments of EV infrastructure maturity, ranking U.S. state (+D.C.) and European country performance across charger per road length, average charge power, electric vehicle fleet share and chargers per EV. New this year, a consumer survey of more than 2,000 drivers across the U.S., France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the UK was conducted by SBD to better understand how drivers experience daily travel, EV adoption barriers and motivations, and how they perceive and experience charging infrastructure.",

Interestingly, there is a slight jump in range anxiety for drivers who have had an electric car for 1-3 years. Unsurprisingly, drivers have higher anxiety about long distance travel with their EVs than daily drives. By five or more years of driving an EV, almost all drivers rate their anxiety below a 1.",
