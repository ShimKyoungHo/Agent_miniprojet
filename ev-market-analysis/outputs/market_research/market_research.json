Stanford economists found that 75% of EV subsidies claimed under the Inflation Reduction Act went to consumers who would have bought an electric vehicle anyway, meaning the government was spending $32,000 to get each additional EV into the market. The CAFE standards forced automakers to subsidize EV production to offset gas-powered vehicles that fell below the standards. Like with the federal fuel economy standards, automakers have to raise prices on gas vehicles in order to pay to meet the state EV mandates, creating a massive wealth transfer that is entirely hidden from auto consumers.",

            "content": "| Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the final standards to regulate the emissions of new light- and medium-duty vehicles sold in the United States, a move that aims to drastically minimize the impact of air pollution resulting from motor vehicles on public health and the climate. According to Audrey LaForest from Automotive News, the EPA “alleviated some of the pressure by giving automakers a longer runway to ramp up electric vehicle production and sales and by adding more flexibility for compliance by factoring in plug-in hybrids and other technologies.” Still, manufacturers will need to scale up production capacity of zero-emission vehicles considerably to meet the targets of this new rule.",

Another transformative electric vehicle trend is the rise of bidirectional charging stations (V2G), which allow EVs to draw power from the grid and supply energy back to it. Installers must stay updated on the latest electric vehicle trends to effectively install and maintain EV charging station infrastructure. This EV trend towards sustainable transportation is motivated by various factors, including heightened environmental concerns and the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, widespread governmental incentives and policies supporting EV adoption, continuous advancements in battery technology resulting in longer driving ranges and the decreasing costs of electric vehicles.",
