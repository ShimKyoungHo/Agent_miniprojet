Sales in Q2 were higher than in Q1 by 4.9%, and total EV sales through the first half of 2025 set a record at 607,089, representing a 1.5% year-over-year increase. The EV pioneer’s share of total U.S. sales (3.4%) and share of the EV market (44.7%) have both declined year-to-date in 2025. In the U.S. market, the used EV market is now the shiny new thing – retail used EV sales surpassed 100,000 units in Q2, a record, and growth is accelerating.",

However, the more electric vehicles roaming the roads, the more public charge points are needed to support the wide EV uptake, especially in dense areas where access to home charging is more limited. Shifting from incentivising the sales of electric cars to supporting heavy-duty transportation and the rollout of EV charging infrastructure is a common phenomenon in mature EV markets.",

Another transformative electric vehicle trend is the rise of bidirectional charging stations (V2G), which allow EVs to draw power from the grid and supply energy back to it. Installers must stay updated on the latest electric vehicle trends to effectively install and maintain EV charging station infrastructure. This EV trend towards sustainable transportation is motivated by various factors, including heightened environmental concerns and the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, widespread governmental incentives and policies supporting EV adoption, continuous advancements in battery technology resulting in longer driving ranges and the decreasing costs of electric vehicles.",
