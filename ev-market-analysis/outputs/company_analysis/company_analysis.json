Under the Biden administration, many of these tariffs remained in place, while new tariffs were introduced on Chinese products and EV imports to counter growing competition and protect the U.S. EV industry.3 While the U.S. automotive industry — particularly EVs — could benefit from the protection tariffs would offer against rising Chinese competition, a trade war could also disrupt supply chains and further increase costs.
